I'm also very passionate about the intersection of math and computer science,specifically algorithm design. I prefer to work on a project that involves more algorithmically challenging problems. For example,I would be much more interested in figuring out what algorithms and data structures to use to improve some software module's performance than building a product's user interface.",,,,,,,,,

I really want to get my hands on a large project where I can learn a lot from experienced engineers. Over the winter,I worked for a small start up where I was mostly doing front-end web development with HTML,CSS,and Javascript. I feel very comfortable with these languages and feel like working on them again for a project would be very boring and tedious. While Typescript may be something I appreciate,I would am really looking for a chance to work with and improve large systems. I really want to get in the weeds of code! I worked with Go before and really love not only working with distributed and network based systems,but the language itself. I also put cyber security as a top pick as that is a field I have a lot of passion for.",,,,,,,,,
