##Plagiarism Checker and the Turnitin® Originality Report
University of Phoenix values academic honesty and integrity in student work. The Plagiarism Checker is an automated tool that enables students and faculty to ensure originality in student work. Students and faculty may submit papers to the CWE and use the Plagiarism Checker to identify unoriginal material.
Every paper students submit to the Plagiarism Checker is returned in the form of a customized Turnitin® Originality Report. This report identifies exact word matches with previously published materials and helps students monitor the originality of submitted papers.

Interpret the Turnitin® Originality Report-
When you submit a paper to the Plagiarism Checker, you receive an Originality Report from Turnitin® that displays matching text in your paper with text from outside sources such as websites, periodicals, journals, and other publications. The Originality Report colors portions of the text to indicate the percentage of matching text with outside sources. The color percentage breakdown follows:
Blue- no mathcing texts
Green - 1-24% matching text
Yellow - 25% - 49% matching text
Orange - 50 to 74% matching text
Red - 75 to 100% macthing text

Similarity Index
The similarity index, located in the top left corner of the Originality Report, indicates the percentage of matching text from outside sources. This percentage is also represented with a color. In the following graphic, green indicates the 1% to 24% matching category.

If there is a high similarity index, this does not necessarily mean the paper is plagiarized. You must determine whether plagiarism has occurred by looking closely at the text highlighted in the paper and comparing it to outside sources displayed on the right side of the report. If the source was properly cited, it will appear as nonoriginal, but it is not plagiarized. Certain assignments require boilerplate information, such as content headings or terminology. This information flags as nonoriginal in the plagiarism reports, but is not plagiarism. A percentage of more than 15% on the Originality Report is an indicator that additional investigation might be required. However, because the similarity index shows sources that are properly cited, it is difficult to provide a specific similarity index percentage that equates to plagiarism. The Plagiarism Checker is a tool. Like any tool, it requires effort and discernment from the operator to be effective.
The Turnitin® report provides you with several display options, or modes, to identify possible plagiarized information. To view the display options, go to the Mode drop-down box in the Originality Report.
